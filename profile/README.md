                        - I believe in writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code. My development process emphasizes:
                        - - **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Writing tests before writing code ensures reliability.
                          - - **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automating workflows for seamless deployments.
                            - - **Agile Methodologies**: Iterative development with a focus on delivering value quickly.
